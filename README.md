# discord_bot

This project is for learning purposes. As Discord is usually open on my computer, this Discord
Bot can serve as a personal assistant. 

The main goal of this project is to: 
- Learn Python and discord.py library, focusing on command handling.
- Hands-on experience working with API calls, documentation, and debugging.
- Utilized Git and GitHub to learn and get familiarized with version control.

Future Goal:
- Implement AI
- Voice Recognition (Not sure if this is possible)


Fun Fact:
- If you search up Gizmo definition on Google this is the meaning: 
"a gadget, especially one whose name the speaker does not know or cannot recall."
